# 📈 Sales Prediction Using Python

This project is a practical example of using machine learning to predict product sales based on advertising budget data. It explores how different advertising channels — **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper** — impact sales, and builds a model to forecast sales performance.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To forecast sales using historical advertising data and build a **Linear Regression** model that helps businesses make data-driven decisions about ad spending.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset used is `advertising.csv`, which contains the following columns:

| Column     | Description                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| TV         | Advertising budget on TV (in thousands)      |
| Radio      | Advertising budget on Radio (in thousands)   |
| Newspaper  | Advertising budget on Newspaper (in thousands)|
| Sales      | Product sales (in thousands of units)        |

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data analysis
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating the regression model

## 🚀 Steps Covered

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Visualize relationships between features and sales
3. Perform correlation analysis
4. Prepare features and labels
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Train a Linear Regression model
7. Evaluate the model using R² and RMSE
8. Visualize predictions vs actual sales
