# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

Welcome to a fun and simple machine learning project â€” classifying Iris flowers!  
This is one of the most popular beginner datasets in data science, and a great way to get comfortable with classification algorithms.

---

## ðŸŒ¼ Project Overview

In this project, we're working with the classic **Iris dataset**, which contains measurements of three types of Iris flowers:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Each flower is described by:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can look at these measurements and **predict which species** the flower belongs to.

## ðŸ¤– What We'll Do

- Load and explore the dataset
- Visualize patterns using simple plots
- Build and train a classification model (weâ€™ll use Random Forest)
- Test how well our model performs
- Predict flower types using the model

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Info

Weâ€™re using the well-known **Iris Flower Dataset**.  
You can find it on [Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset), or you can load it directly using `scikit-learn`.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python 3
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling
- scikit-learn for building the model
- (Optional) Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the code manually):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
